# School District Analysis Overview
## The State Board of Education has resquested detail analysis on student funding and standarized testing scores to help the board determine budget allocations. The following key metrics have been requested:
###-Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
###-The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
###-The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
###-School performance based on the budget per student
###-School performance based on the school size 
###-School performance based on the type of school
##The school board has found evidence of academic dishonesty in the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. The analysis with the key metrics will be repeated with the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders excluded. The key metrics before and after the exclusion will be compared to determine the affect of changes in the overall analysis.
